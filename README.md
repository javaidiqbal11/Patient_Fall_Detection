# Patient Fall Prevention Detection

## Overview
This project aims to provide a real-time solution for detecting and preventing patient falls in healthcare settings. Using deep learning approaches and pose estimation, the system monitors and alerts healthcare staff when a fall is detected. The project is built using Python 3.10 and the PyTorch framework and is designed to run on Windows, with support for both standalone and server deployment.

## Features
- Real-Time Detection: Continuously monitors patients to detect falls in real-time.
- Pose Estimation: Leverages pose estimation models to analyze patient movements and identify potential fall risks.
- Deep Learning: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to improve accuracy.
- Windows Installer: Available as an executable for easy installation on Windows systems.
- Server Deployment: Supports deployment on servers for use in larger healthcare networks.

##Requirements
Python 3.10
PyTorch
OpenCV
Numpy
Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1- Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/patient-fall-detection.git
cd patient-fall-detection
```
2. Install the required packages:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Ensure you have the necessary hardware for running deep learning models (e.g., GPU if required).

## Running the Fall Detection System
To start the fall detection system:

```shell
python fall_detector.py
```
This will launch the application and start monitoring patient movements in real-time.

## Deployment
**Standalone (Windows Installer)**
- Download the pre-built Windows installer.
- Follow the installation instructions to set up the application on your system.
- Run the application directly from the installed program.

## Server Deployment
1. Configure your server environment.
2. Deploy the fall detection system on your server by setting up the required dependencies and running the system as a background process or service.
3. Ensure the network is configured to handle real-time data processing.

## Model Training and Fine-tuning
This project uses pre-trained pose estimation models. If you need to train or fine-tune the model:

1. Place your dataset in the appropriate folder.
2. Modify the training script as needed.
3. Run the training command:

```shell
python train_model.py
```
